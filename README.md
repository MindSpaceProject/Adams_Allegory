# Adam's Allegory

**Adam's Allegory** is as an **interactive-story computer game** used to help diagnose children and teenagers with childhood anxiety disorders. This game will help assess a child's mental health state through an episodic, adventure experience. At the start of the game, the players are asked to play as though they're the main character. When presented with questions, the players would give the responses that best represents their real-life thoughts, feelings, or experiences. Throughout the game, the players would be indicating how they react in different potentially anxiety provoking scenarios. The scenario questions are adapted from the SCARED anxiety screening. The player will be given scores based on their selections within the game. These scoring results reflect their inferred anxiety levels and will be readily available at the conclusion of the game. This game is intended to be completed in one sitting.

Our product would not act as a definite diagnosis, but rather a screening to help assess the child's mental health state and bring awareness that their score falls into an unusual anxiety range, similar to how the anxiety questionnaires are currently being used.

## Intended Audience
The intended audience for this product are psychiatrists, clinicians, parents, and other adults looking for resources to help assess children and teenagers with anxiety. The target age group for the children and teenagers playing the game are ages 11 to 18. Adam's Allegory would be made free to use and be available for download publicly through our installer. This product should only be used as a tool to help diagnose children with anxiety disorders.

## Game Chapters
We split the game into 5 main chapters, with each assessing a different childhood anxiety disorder. The final chapter serves as a conclusion to the storyline.

* Chapter 1: Separation Anxiety Disorder
* Chapter 2: Significant School Avoidance
* Chapter 3: Generalized Anxiety Disorder
* Chapter 4: Social Anxiety Disorder
* Chapter 5: Panic Disorder
* Chapter 6: Conclusion
