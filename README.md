# Adam's Allegory

**Adam's Allegory** is as an **interactive-story computer game** used to help diagnose children and teenagers with childhood anxiety disorders. This game will help assess a child's mental health state through an episodic, adventure experience. Each chapter of the game will assess a different anxiety disorder. Throughout the game, the players would be indicating how they react in different potentially anxiety provoking scenarios. The scenario questions are adapted from the SCARED anxiety screening. The player will be given scores based on their selections within the game. These scoring results reflect their inferred anxiety levels and will be readily available at the conclusion of the game. This game is intended to be completed in one sitting.

Our product would not act as a definite diagnosis, but rather a screening to help assess the child's mental health state and bring awareness that their score falls into an unusual anxiety range, similar to how the anxiety questionnaires are currently being used.

## Intended Audience
The intended audience for this product are psychiatrists, clinicians, parents, and other adults looking for resources to help assess children and teenagers with anxiety. The target age ground for the children and teenagers playing the game are ages 11 to 18. Adam's Allegory would be made free to use and be available for download publicly on our website. This product should only be used as a tool to help diagnose children with anxiety disorders.
