  dialogue:
  - "Bro, this remote is broken. I keep pressing the block and it doesn\u2019t block.
    That\u2019s the only reason why you're winning."
  - "What\u2019s that smug look on your face Adam!? \r\n"
  - Alright bro, see me next week and I'm gonna win EASILY.
  playerDialogue:
  - "Didn\u2019t you just get that a couple days ago? Can\u2019t imagine it broke
    this quickly\u2026"
  - Oh this look? It's the look of a superior gamer!
  - "We\u2019ll see about that!"
  - 'Last night, I told my parents about the panic attack I had. '
  - They talked to me more about what a panic attack is, taught me some breathing
    exercises for the future, and gave me some reassurance that I was going to be
    okay.
  - They also think that being around friends would be good for me today. Now I'm
    at Tommy's place for our sleepover!
  - 'When I first found out my family was moving, I was really worried. Having to
    make new friends and just being in a new environment made me feel nervous. '
  - "I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. I wasn\u2019t sure if anyone would like me."
  - "But Tommy, Stacy, my parents, Josh, and even Teddy helped set some of those
    anxious thoughts to rest. They helped me realize that I\u2019m going to be okay."
  - And you will be too. See ya later!
