  dialogue:
  - "That\u2019s enough video games, Adam. You know you have school tomorrow."
  - How are you feeling about tomorrow?
  - "Hmmm. Are you usually worried about going to school? Or is it because you\u2019re
    at a new school?"
  - "You will! I\u2019m sure Tommy can also introduce you to some people."
  - "It\u2019s almost time for supper. You want to help me make dinner?"

  playerDialogue:
  - "Man, this Sunday is going by fast. And I have school tomorrow\u2026"
  - "I\u2019m usually scared to go to school."
  - Sometimes, I get scared to go to school.
  - "I\u2019m never really scared about going to school."
  - I wanna play a video game to ease my nerves though. I should go turn on my game
    console.
  - I know, I just wanted to squeeze a game in.
  - "*Thinking to himself* She\u2019s always popping up out of nowhere\u2026"
  - A little worried, honestly.
  - "I\u2019m always worried about going to school."
  - "Sometimes I\u2019m a little worried about going to school."
  - "I\u2019m not usually worried about going to school."
  - "But like you said, I\u2019ll be at a new school. I just hope I can make some
    friends."
  - Sure!
