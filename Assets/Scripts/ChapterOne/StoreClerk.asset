  dialogue:
  - Well hello Adam! Yes, I spoke with your parents when they first came in. Welcome
    to the neighborhood!
  - "Oh yes, they had rushed outside for some reason. Looked like they saw someone
    they knew.\r"
  playerDialogue:
  - "Hello, I\u2019m Adam. My family and I are new in town."
  - "Thank you. Speaking of my parents...did you happen to see where they went? I
    can\u2019t find them anywhere.\r"
  - Oh okay, thank you. I guess I should check outside then.
