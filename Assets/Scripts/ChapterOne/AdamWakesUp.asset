  - I had a nightmare about my parents disappearing. It was at the grocery store,
    just like yesterday.
  - "Only this time, they were not outside. They were nowhere in sight, and I couldn\u2019t
    find them anywhere."
  - I usually have nightmares about something bad happening to my parents.
  - Sometimes I have nightmares about something bad happening to my parents.
  - " I don\u2019t usually have nightmares about them like this."
  - While I was outside looking for them, something tried to grab me. I ran as fast
    as I could...but it caught me in the end.
  - I usually have nightmares about something bad happening to me.
  - Sometimes I have nightmares like that.
  - "I don\u2019t usually have nightmares like that."
  - Thankfully it was just a dream...
