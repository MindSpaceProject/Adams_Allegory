  dialogue:
  - "Adam! Sorry honey, we rushed outside when we saw Tommy\u2019s mother out here!
    I didn\u2019t even realize how much time had gone by."
  - "Adam! Look at you, you\u2019re so grown up now!\r\n"
  - "Aren\u2019t you excited about your sleepover with Tommy next weekend honey?\r\n"
  - "We\u2019ll prepare the guest room downstairs so that you can have a room to
    yourself! The other rooms are upstairs, so it\u2019ll be nice and quiet for you."
  - Alright, we should probably finish shopping and hurry home. It was nice running
    into you, Becca!
  - See you soon! Take care!
  playerDialogue:
  - Mom? Dad?
  - Nice to see you again, Ms. Duncan.
  - Yeah, it will be nice to see him again.
  - "*Thinking to himself* I\u2019ll be sleeping downstairs by myself? "
  - I usually worry about sleeping alone, even when I do.
  - Sometimes I worry about sleeping alone.
  - I never really worry about sleeping alone.
  - "It is nice that they\u2019d let me sleep in there though."
