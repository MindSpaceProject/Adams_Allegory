  - Hmm, you sure you're not gonna get scared and run away like you used to?
  - Well, I'm glad that you're so excited! But honey, I actually came in to let you
    know that your father and I will be heading out for a bit.
  - We need to get some things from the grocery store.
  - "Are you afraid of being alone in the house?\r"
  - 'You know what, it would be nice for you to learn your way around the neighborhood.
    You can come with us.

'
  - "Let\u2019s head to the grocery store now."
  playerDialogue:
  - "Sheesh mom, where did you even come from?! Also, that was years ago, but\u2026"
  - I do get a little scared if I sleep away from home...
  - Sometimes I do get scared if I sleep away from home.
  - I never get scared about sleeping away from home now!
  - "But regardless, chilling with Tommy was always fun!\r"
  - "Where are you going?\r"
  - "*Thinking to himself* They\u2019re going somewhere without me?"
  - I usually follow them wherever they go.
  - "Sometimes I follow them wherever they go\u2026\r\n"
  - "I\u2019m fine with them going places without me."
  - "Yes, I\u2019m usually afraid to be home alone."
  - "Sometimes\u2026."
  - "No, I\u2019m not afraid to be home alone."
  - "Okay, that\u2019s cool."
  - " I talked to Tommy on the phone last night and he invited me over for a sleepover
    next weekend. I haven\u2019t seen him since we were young."
