  dialogue:
  - Adam, you made it!
  - "That\u2019s right, you haven\u2019t really made that many new friends yet."
  - Well then, this is the perfect opportunity to branch out.
  - "Is it hard for you to talk to people you don\u2019t know that well?"
  - "My friend Josh is here. You could start out by talking to him. He\u2019s super
    cool and easy to talk to!\r"
  - Adam, you actually came!
  - "Haven\u2019t tripped over your own feet yet, have you?"
  - " You should start us off! I\u2019d love to see you dance."
  - "That\u2019s a great idea, Stacy!"
  - "Adam, do you ever feel nervous when other people watch you while you\u2019re
    doing something, like dancing or playing a sport?"
  - You're the new kid. It would be awesome if you were the first one to start dancing!
    Show us what you got!
  - Dude, that was awesome!
  - Hey, I see Josh on the other side of the gym. You should go talk to him! He's
    the one with the purple hair.
  - Bye! Good luck!
  playerDialogue:
  - "Hey Tommy, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I barely know anyone else."
  - "I did become friends with Stacy, but I don\u2019t see her here yet."
  - Yes, it is!
  - "Sometimes\u2026"
  - No, not at all.
  - "Okay, I\u2019ll do that."
  - ' Hey Stacy! And yeah, I thought it would be cool.'
  - No, thankfully. It seems like no one is really dancing yet anyway.
  - Me? Dance?
  - Yeah, all the time
  - Sometimes I feel nervous about it
  - "No, I don\u2019t feel nervous in those situations."
  - Okay, sounds good. See you later Tommy! Bye Stacy!
