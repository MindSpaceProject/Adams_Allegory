  dialogue:
  - Hey Adam, you just moved here last week right?
  - Not at all! I just recognize everyone here but you, haha! So, how have you been
    liking Jefferson Academy?
  - "I feel you. I was the new kid once, so I understand what you\u2019re going through.
    It feels weird trying to make new friends when everyone has already formed their
    friend groups."
  - "Do you get shy around people you don\u2019t know well?"
  - Does it make you nervous too? Meeting new people?
  - I was shy and nervous when I moved here. Definitely gave off new kid vibes for
    a solid month. But after some time went by, I made some friends and was no longer
    considered the new kid. So just hang in there, Adam.
  - Have you made any friends here yet?
  - You can include me in that count too if you want! We could hangout sometime for
    sure.
  - "Bet. Why don\u2019t you walk around the gym and try talking to new people?"
  - ' Sounds good! Good luck!'
  playerDialogue:
  - "Hey Josh. My name is Adam. I\u2019m friends with Tommy."
  - "Did I give off new kid vibes or something\u2026"
  - "It\u2019s been okay. I\u2019ve just been slowly trying to navigate how to do
    things here."
  - "That\u2019s exactly how I\u2019m feeling!"
  - Yes, I do
  - "Sometimes\u2026"
  - No, not at all
  - Yeah.
  - Sometimes...
  - Nope
  - "I\u2019ll take your word for it."
  - Other than Tommy and Stacy, not really.
  - That would be cool!
  - "Yeah, I\u2019ll try that.\r\n"
  - Thanks, see you later Josh!
  - '*Thinking to himself* I guess I should try talking to some people here.'
