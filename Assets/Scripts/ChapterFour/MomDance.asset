  dialogue:
  - Are you excited for the dance, honey?
  - "I understand. You know, I used to get really nervous when going to places where
    there would be people I didn\u2019t know well."
  - Parties, school dances, or any social event really.
  - "Well, that\u2019s how I am now. I love talking to new people! But when I was
    younger, I was extremely shy!"
  - "I feel like this is going to be a great chance for you to make some friends,
    Adam. \r"
  - " It looks like you\u2019re ready to go. I hope you\u2019re okay with walking
    over there. Your dad has the car now, but should be back before the dance is
    over."
  - Okay honey, be safe!
  playerDialogue:
  - 'The next few days went by fairly quickly. It is now Friday afternoon.

    Adam
    is about to head to the dance.

'
  - "The school dance is tonight. I won\u2019t really know anyone there other than
    Tommy and Stacy\u2026"
  - "I don't like to be around people I don\u2019t know well."
  - "Sometimes I don\u2019t like to be around people I don\u2019t know well."
  - "I don\u2019t mind being around people I don\u2019t know well at all!"
  - "Hopefully it won\u2019t be too bad."
  - Yeah!
  - Nope
  - I mean, I guess?
  - " I still don\u2019t have that many friends at school, so I won\u2019t really
    know anyone."
  - '*thinking to himself* Hmmm...'
  - "I usually feel nervous going to social events where there will be people I don\u2019t
    know well"
  - Sometimes I feel like that too.
  - "I don\u2019t really get nervous in those situations. "
  - "I\u2019m surprised to hear that. I\u2019ve always seen you being really social
    around others."
  - "I\u2019m shy too."
  - Sometimes I get shy.
  - "I\u2019m not a shy person."
  - "Yeah, that\u2019s what I was thinking!"
  - "I don\u2019t mind walking. And since Tommy will be there, I could walk home
    with him too."
  - Got it, see you later Mom!
