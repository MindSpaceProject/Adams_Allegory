  dialogue:
  - You okay boy? What are you doing in this park so late?
  - "My name is Teddy. I\u2019m part of the neighborhood watch. I patrol this area
    every other night. "
  - What happened Adam?
  - Hmmm....interesting.
  - Hey kid, do people ever tell you that you look nervous?
  - "You mentioned that you felt like you were choking and throwing up. Do you usually
    feel like you\u2019re choking when you\u2019re scared?"
  - "How about throwing up? Do you feel nauseous when you\u2019re scared?"
  - 'Adam, it sounds like you had a panic attack. '
  - "I\u2019ve been in this area all night, and I didn\u2019t hear any strange noises.
    It was probably all in your head."
  - I had a couple panic attacks when I was younger. They would usually be triggered
    by my own fear, I would feel like I was going crazy.
  - "Yup, a lot of the time when I was scared, there was no pinpoint reason, it just\u2026happened.
    Which seems to have been the case for you tonight."
  - For me, the panic attacks would occur every couple of weeks, and I thought I
    was losing my mind. My parents saw how I was struggling and took me to the doctor
    for help.
  - "I don\u2019t know what sparked your panic attack. Could be because you were
    walking home alone at night, or it could have been you overthinking about something
    and getting anxious. "
  - But make sure you tell your parents about what happened.
  - "Alright, I\u2019ll walk you home now. "
  - No problem kid. Just be careful out there, especially at night.
  playerDialogue:
  - '*Thinking to himself* After what felt like an eternity, my breathing had slowed
    down. I could finally let go of all the fear and racing thoughts..'
  - "Who\u2026who are you?"
  - 'Oh. My name is Adam. My family and I just moved here last week. '
  - I...I feel so drained and exhausted.
  - 'Adam explains what happened and the different feelings he experienced. '
  - Yes
  - Sometimes
  - No
  - A panic attack?
  - "I get those often. I\u2019m afraid of having panic attacks."
  - "Sometimes I get those and I\u2019m afraid of having them."
  - "I don\u2019t have those often and I'm usually not worried about having one."
  - "That\u2019s exactly how it felt for me tonight."
  - "*Thinking to himself* Going crazy huh\u2026"
  - "When I get scared, I usually feel like I\u2019m going crazy."
  - Sometimes I feel like that.
  - "I never feel like I\u2019m going crazy when I\u2019m scared."
  - I usually get really frightened for no reason at all.
  - Sometimes I get really frightened for no reason at all.
  - This usually doesn't happen to me.
  - "I\u2019m glad that you were able to get the help that you needed."
  - "Okay, I will. Thank you.\r"
  - Thanks for the help, Teddy.
  - "Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be walking at night by myself
    anytime soon..."
