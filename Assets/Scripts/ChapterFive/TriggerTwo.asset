  - "What is that noise??\r"
  - "Who\u2019s there?"
  - It sounds like the noise is coming from INSIDE my mind. And it came out of nowhere.
  - "My heart feels like it\u2019s pounding out of my chest\u2026it\u2019s beating
    so fast."
  - "This happens when I\u2019m scared."
  - "Sometimes this happens when I\u2019m scared."
  - "This never happens when I\u2019m scared."
  - "I\u2019m having trouble breathing. It feels like I can\u2019t get enough air
    in, no matter how hard I breathe."
  - "This happens when I\u2019m frightened."
  - "Sometimes this happens when I\u2019m frightened."
  - "This never happens when I\u2019m frightened."
  - Let me hurry home.
  - It gets louder as I head towards my house...is something coming towards me?!
  - "There\u2019s an old shed in the park. I could try heading there instead...and
    then I'll call Mom and ask her to pick me up."
