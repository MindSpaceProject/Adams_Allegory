  dialogue:
  - "Yeah! It\u2019s crazy how we ended up getting reunited after all these years.
    In Iowa, of all places."
  - Yeah, my Dad got me a new game console for my birthday. We can play with that
    when you come through!
  - Oh right, you must be really nervous too.
  - Are you usually a nervous person?
  - "I wouldn\u2019t be too nervous if I were you. Your personality is great. I\u2019m
    sure everyone will want to be your friend!"
  - "There\u2019s also a lot of different school clubs you could join to meet new
    people."
  - "No problem Adam! Good luck today and let me know if you need anything. Now let\u2019s
    keep moving so we\u2019re not late!"
  playerDialogue:
  - "Man, it\u2019s been so great catching up with you, Tommy!"
  - "Haha, I know right. I\u2019m just glad to have a friend here already. And I\u2019m
    excited for our sleepover on Saturday."
  - That sounds great!
  - "*Sighs* Wow, for a second I forgot that we\u2019re on our way to school."
  - "Yes, I\u2019m a nervous person."
  - Sometimes I can be a nervous person.
  - "I\u2019m not really a nervous person."
  - 'Thanks, Tommy. '
