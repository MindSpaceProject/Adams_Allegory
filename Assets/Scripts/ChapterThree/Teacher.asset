  dialogue:
  - "Adam! Nice to finally meet you. My name is Mrs. Thompson, and I\u2019ll be your
    English and Homeroom teacher."
  - I know how nervous the first day of school can be, especially when it comes to
    making new friends.
  - "Here\u2019s my advice: Don\u2019t worry about whether other people will like
    you or not. Just be yourself."
  - How are you feeling about today?
  - When I was your age, I would always expect things to go wrong for me.
  - "I just couldn\u2019t stop overthinking everything! I\u2019d always worry about
    being as good as the other kids."
  - "I\u2019d worry about mistakes I\u2019d make on school projects, with friends,
    and just in life. "
  - "I had to challenge my worries, and start asking myself, \u201CWhat if things
    work out?\u201D and \u201CWhat if all my hard work pays off?\u201D And that simple
    strategy of being hopeful has helped me so much."
  - Do you ever worry about things working out for you?
  - Adam, I want you to always feel comfortable coming to me or any of your teachers
    for help if you feel like you need it.
  - "You\u2019re very welcome. I look forward to getting to know you more this semester,
    Adam. "
  - "Why don\u2019t you try talking to the student in the classroom? Maybe you\u2019ll
    make a new friend."
  playerDialogue:
  - "Hi, I\u2019m Adam. I just transferred here."
  - Nice to meet you, Mrs. Thompson.
  - "*Thinking to himself*  Hmmm\u2026."
  - 'I usually worry about other people liking me. '
  - Sometimes I worry about other people liking me.
  - "I don\u2019t really worry about other people liking me."
  - Honestly, I expect something to go wrong today.
  - I'm feeling really confident about today!
  - Ehhh, it's school.
  - Why?
  - "*Thinking to himself* Worrying about being as good as other kids\u2026"
  - I worry about this all the time.
  - Sometimes I worry about this.
  - I never really worry about that.
  - So what did you do about it?
  - "That\u2019s nice to hear!"
  - Yes, all the time.
  - Sometimes
  - "I don\u2019t really worry about that."
  - Thank you, Mrs. Thompson.
