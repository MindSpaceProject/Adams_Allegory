  dialogue:
  - You must be Adam!
  - Stacy.
  - "Well, I\u2019m trying to think of a school club to sign up for. My Dad has been
    putting a lot of pressure on me about it. But I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m
    interested in."
  - Tommy is right! I was thinking of joining the drama club because it sounds fun.
    But my Dad says I should think deeper about my future and pick a club that will
    help me achieve my goals.
  - Not really. I usually start getting nervous when I think about the future, so
    I just avoid thinking about it.
  - "Do you ever worry about what is going to happen in the future?\r"
  - "You\u2019re right, thanks Adam! It was nice meeting you!"
  playerDialogue:
  - "Yep, the new kid! What\u2019s your name?"
  - Nice to meet you, Stacy. What are you up to?
  - "That\u2019s understandable. My friend Tommy told me there\u2019s a lot of different
    clubs here to choose from."
  - Do you even know what you want to do in the future?
  - All the time...
  - Sometimes...
  - Not really.
  - "But don\u2019t stress it too much. We\u2019ll be okay. Try going for the Drama
    club, and if you don\u2019t like it, you can try something else."
  - It was cool meeting you too! See you later!
  - '*Thinking to himself* I should probably head to gym class now.'
