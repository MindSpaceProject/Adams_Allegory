  dialogue:
  - Adam! Of course not, you can sit there.
  - "The school dance that\u2019s happening on Friday! I\u2019m so excited! You\u2019re
    going, right!?"
  - "Oh no! I can't imagine how embarrassing that must've been for you. If that were
    me, I\u2019d be thinking about it for weeks after it happened."
  - Haha, sorry. I just tend to worry about things that have already happened a lot.
  - " I do it all the time. My Dad always says I\u2019m a huge worrier.\r"
  - " Yeah. I worry about a lot of things all the time.\r"
  - Would you consider yourself a worrier?
  - "Anyway, I\u2019m sure you won't trip over your feet this time around. You should
    go to the dance.\r"
  - "Definitely. So, it sounds like you\u2019re going?"
  - Great! I hope you have a lot of fun there!
  playerDialogue:
  - 'I think Stacy has this same lunch period. I could go talk to her. '
  - "Hey! This seat isn\u2019t taken, is it?"
  - What were you thinking about? You were smiling :)
  - Last time I went to a dance, I tripped over my own two feet.
  - "Thanks\u2026that makes me feel a lot better\u2026"
  - I usually worry about things that have already happened, too.
  - Sometimes I worry about things that have already happened.
  - I don't tend to worry about things that have already happened.
  - Really?
  - Yes, I worry a lot.
  - Maybe? I worry sometimes.
  - "No, I don\u2019t worry that often."
  - "A school dance would be a good opportunity to make some more friends\u2026"
  - I guess I will go.
  - Haha, I hope so too.
